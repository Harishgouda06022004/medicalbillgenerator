# medicalbillgenerator
A simple web-based Medical Bill Generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to add medical items, calculate the total cost, and print a professional-looking bill. The print feature automatically hides unnecessary buttons like "Print" and "Remove" for a clean bill output.
